 * 1.  etc/module.xml is one of the three require files to bootstrap a module
 * 2.  Each module needs this file with almost the same structure
 * 3.  Difference between each other would be values at the name and setup_version of the module 
 *     tag
 * 4.  name attribute value should be the same that you use as componentName at the 
 *     registration.php file
 * 5.  setup_version attribute value indicates which upgrade should run 
 * 6.  Before installed your module it didn't appears at the [magento-path]etc/config.php file 
 *     and it is
 *     not listed at the setup_module table in your database
 * 7.  After you run the module installation a row would exist in both the [magento-path]etc/
 *     config.php and at the setup_module table
 * 8.  Sometimes you need to modify or add something to the database before the first time you 
 *     run the module instalation and to manage it the setup_version exists, need to run and 
 *     upgrade from the module? Change your setup version then.
 * 9.  You can add a sequence tag that should be used when you are going to modify something of 
 *     another
 *     module (plugins, events, layouts, etc) You need it because if your module runs first the 
 *     other module would rewrite your functionality
 * 10. Imagine you are going to create a new module to add regions of your country then you need 
 *     to add a sequence tag to let Magento know you need run your module after the Magento 
 *     Directory module.
 * 11. This file is one of the "Module cofiguration files". Abou this check following information:
 *
 *         a) Magento’s multiple configuration files load on demand only when a module requests a 
 *            specific configuration type.
 *         b) You can use these files to customize specific aspects of your module’s behavior. 
 *         c) Multiple modules can declare configuration files that affect the same configuration 
 *            type.
 *         d) Magento loads configuration files in the following order: 
 *             
 *                i)   Primary configuration (app/etc/di.xml). This file is used to bootstrap 
 *                     Magento.
 *                ii)  Global configurations from modules. It means all *.xml files in each 
 *                     module etc subdirectory.
 *                iii) Area-specific configuration from modules. It menas all *.xml files in each 
 *                     module etc/<area> subdirectory. Areas could be: adminhtml & frontend then 
 *                     to specify you should create your configuration file within your module 
 *                     etc/adminhtml or etc/frontend subdirectory.
